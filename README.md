# Python ORM and FastAPI CRUD Application

This project is  for the IEE 305 Information Systems Engineering class at ASU. I created a database system using Python and SQLModel ORM to manage customers, products, and orders data. I also built a FastAPI application that allows basic create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on customers through REST API routes. The project includes the Python scripts for the database models and the API, as well as the project documentation. 

Files included: main.py, hw5_orm.py, HW5.pdf, hw5.db
